# Set Testing to 1 IF RaceDB exits after it starts. This can help debug why. Otherwise, the container will
# just keep restarting. THis stops this from happening. Normal behaviour is RaceDB starts, and exits when the
# container is shutdown

#
# Launch in Hub Mode is defined

#
# Changing the Port Number used by RaceDB is not done here. Update the port mapping in the docker-compose
# file because we have to tell docker which port(s) we are using

#
# External Database configuration
#
# For normal operation, do not expose these env vars. If you are attempting to use the racedb container
# on an external database, you must define these vars. Postgres and Mysql/MariaDB are supported, although, neither has
# been tested. The vars should be self explanitory. Refer to the docker-entrypoint-init.d directory in git
# for details on how there work.
